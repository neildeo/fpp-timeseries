A Box-Cox transform cannot be used for the Canadian gas data in canadian_gas
because the period of highest fluctuations (1977 - 1989) does not coincide
with the period of highest prices (which increase linearly over time).

In other words, a monotonic transform will not stabilise the variation in the
data.
