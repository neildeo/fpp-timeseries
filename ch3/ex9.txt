The STL decomposition of the employment data shows a steady increasing trend 
of roughly linear shape. The seasonality is rather complex, but is a rather 
minor effect compared to the trend and the remainder. The magnitude of the 
seasonal effect is very gradually increasing over time. The remainder shows a 
clear dip in 1991-92, suggesting an event that the STL model is failing to 
capture.

The season plot shows no clear pattern in monthly trends, but it does highlight
that the seasonal peaks come in March, September and December (quarter ends?).

The 1991-92 recession is only visible in the noise, which suggests that this 
model is not sufficiently expressive to capture such events.
